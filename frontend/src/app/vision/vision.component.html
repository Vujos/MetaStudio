<h2 class="title">Stakeholder and User Descriptions</h2>
<p class="description">To effectively provide products and services that meet your stakeholders’ and users' real needs, it is necessary to identify and involve all of the stakeholders as part of the Requirements Modeling process. You must also identify the users of the system and ensure that the stakeholder community adequately represents them. This section provides a profile of the stakeholders and users involved in the project, and the key problems that they perceive to be addressed by the proposed solution. It does not describe their specific requests or requirements as these are captured in a separate stakeholder requests artifact. Instead, it provides the background and justification for why the requirements are needed.</p>

<mat-form-field appearance="outline">
    <mat-label>Market Demographics</mat-label>
    <textarea matInput placeholder="Summarize the key market demographics that motivate your product decisions. Describe and position target market segments. Estimate the market’s size and growth by using the number of potential users or the amount of money your customers spend trying to meet needs that your product or enhancement would fulfill. Review major industry trends and technologies. Answer these strategic questions:

• 	What is your organization’s reputation in these markets? 
•	What would you like it to be? 
• 	How does this product or service support your goals?

    •	How long is a task cycle? Amount of time spent in each activity? Is this changing?
    •	Any unique environmental constraints: mobile, outdoors, in-flight, and so on?
    •	Which systems platforms are in use today? Future platforms?
    •	What other applications are in use? Does your application need to integrate with them?

    This is where extracts from the Business Model could be included to outline the task and roles involved and so on.

<mat-form-field appearance="outline">
    <mat-label>Stakeholder Profiles</mat-label>
    <textarea matInput placeholder="Describe each stakeholder in the system. Remember that stakeholder types can be as divergent as users, departments, and technical developers. A thorough profile would cover the following topics for each type of stakeholder."></textarea>
</mat-form-field>

<mat-form-field appearance="outline">
    <mat-label>User Profiles</mat-label>
    <textarea matInput placeholder="Describe each unique user of the system. Remember user types can be as divergent as gurus and novices. For example, a guru might need a sophisticated, flexible tool with cross-platform support, while a novice might need a tool that is easy to use and user-friendly. A thorough profile needs to cover the following topics for each type of user."></textarea>
</mat-form-field>

<mat-form-field appearance="outline">
    <mat-label>Key Stakeholder or User Needs</mat-label>
    <textarea matInput placeholder="List the key problems with existing solutions as perceived by the stakeholder or user. Clarify the following issues for each problem:
   
    •	What are the reasons for this problem? 
    •	How is it solved now?

<mat-form-field appearance="outline">
    <mat-label>Alternatives and Competition</mat-label>
    <textarea matInput placeholder="Identify alternatives the stakeholder perceives as available.

<h2 class="title">Product Overview</h2>
<p class="description">This section provides a high level view of the product capabilities, interfaces to other applications, and system configurations.</p>

<mat-form-field appearance="outline">
    <mat-label>Product Perspective</mat-label>
    <textarea matInput placeholder="This subsection of the Vision document puts the product in perspective to other related products and the user’s environment. If the product is independent and totally self-contained, state it here. If the product is a component of a larger system, then this subsection needs to relate how these systems interact and needs to identify the relevant interfaces between the systems. One easy way to display the major components of the larger system, interconnections, and external interfaces is with a block diagram."></textarea>
</mat-form-field>

<mat-form-field appearance="outline">
    <mat-label>Summary of Capabilities</mat-label>
    <textarea matInput placeholder="Summarize the major benefits and features the product will provide. For example, a Vision document for a customer support system may use this part to address problem documentation, routing, and status reporting without mentioning the amount of detail each of these functions requires.
    Organize the functions so the list is understandable to the customer or to anyone else reading the document for the first time. A simple listing the key benefits and their supporting features might suffice."></textarea>
</mat-form-field>

<mat-form-field appearance="outline">
    <mat-label>Assumptions and Dependencies</mat-label>
    <textarea matInput placeholder="List each of the factors that affect the features stated in the Vision document. List assumptions that, if changed, will alter the Vision document. For example, an assumption may state that a specific operating system will be available for the hardware designated for the software product. If the operating system is not available, the Vision document will need to change."></textarea>
</mat-form-field>

<mat-form-field appearance="outline">
    <mat-label>Cost and Pricing</mat-label>
    <textarea matInput placeholder="For products sold to external customers and for many in-house applications, cost and pricing issues can directly impact the application’s definition and implementation. In this section, record any cost and pricing constraints that are relevant. For example, distribution costs, (# of diskettes, # of CD-ROMs, CD mastering) or other cost of goods sold constraints (manuals, packaging) may be material to the projects success, or irrelevant, depending on the nature of the application."></textarea>
</mat-form-field>

<mat-form-field appearance="outline">
    <mat-label>Licensing and Installation</mat-label>
    <textarea matInput placeholder="Licensing and installation issues can also directly impact the development effort. For example, the need to support serializing, password security or network licensing will create additional requirements of the system that must be considered in the development effort.
    Installation requirements may also affect coding or create the need for separate installation software."></textarea>
</mat-form-field>

<br>

<h2 class="title">Product Features</h2>
<p class="description">List and briefly describe the product features. Features are the high-level capabilities of the system that are necessary to deliver benefits to the users. Each feature is an externally desired service that typically requires a series of inputs to achieve the desired result. For example, a feature of a problem tracking system might be the ability to provide trending reports. As the use-case model takes shape, update the description to refer to the use cases.
    Because the Vision document is reviewed by a wide variety of involved personnel, the level of detail needs to be general enough for everyone to understand. However, enough detail must be available to provide the team with the information they need to create a use-case model.
    To effectively manage application complexity, we recommend for any new system, or an increment to an existing system, capabilities are abstracted to a high enough level so 25-99 features result. These features provide the fundamental basis for product definition, scope management, and project management. Each feature will be expanded in greater detail in the use-case model.
    Throughout this section, each feature will be externally perceivable by users, operators or other external systems. These features need to include a description of functionality and any relevant usability issues that must be addressed. The following guidelines apply:
    
    •	Avoid design. Keep feature descriptions at a general level. Focus on capabilities needed and why (not how)	 they should be implemented.

    <mat-label>Online Help</mat-label>
    <textarea matInput placeholder="Many applications provide an online help system to assist the user. The nature of these systems is unique to application development as they combine aspects of programming (hyperlinks, and so forth) with aspects of technical writing, such as organization and presentation. Many have found the development of an online help system is a project within a project that benefits from up-front scope management and planning activity."></textarea>
